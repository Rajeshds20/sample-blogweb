                    I have been always interested in building new things and exploring the problems and making solutions with technology.
                    I have been a web developer for the past 6 months and have worked on various projects.
                    Web development is one of my interested areas in technology as a Computer Science student.
                    May be in near future I wanted to build a revolutionary product in the field of This amid technology by forming a swarm of ambient developers.
