        "content": "I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

Ever since I gave a try on StackUp, I made it a habit as it gives me a ambient experience and best pathway for learning any topic. And the Quests it provides makes me to try all the essential deliverables and the material in the pathway are absolutely designed for beginners. As a web developer the Campaigns that are related to may field and the projects that are given in the campaigns are really helpful for me to learn and to build my skills. I am trying and doing the quests by learning all aspects of FullStack Development and all essential Frameworks. I am really thankful to StackUp for providing such a great platform for learning and building skills. I am really looking forward to learn more and more from StackUp. I am currently applying the skills I am and being learnt in my Web Development Projects."
